## General info
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. This is my own version written in Java Swing. 

The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combinethem to create a tile with the number 2048.  

It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS and released on 9 March 2014 as free and open-source. It is played on a 4x4 grid using the arrows or W, A, S, D keys alternatively. Every time you press a key - all tiles slide. Tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged.  

Although there might be an optimal strategy to play, there is always some level of chance. If you beat the game and would like to master it, try to finish with a smaller score. That would mean that you finished with less moves.
